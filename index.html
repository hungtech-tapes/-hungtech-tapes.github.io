<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>According to ASTM staff
responsible for maintaining standards developed by Committee D01, “Paint
and Related Coatings, Materials and Applications,” ASTM D3359, “Standard Test Methods for Rating Adhesion by Tape Test” is one of the
most frequently downloaded standards from Volume 06.01. First published in
1974, it is widely used in a variety of industries and applications. It can be
performed in the laboratory, shop, or field on both newly applied and aged
protective coating systems. It is relatively easy to perform and does not
require specialized equipment. Yet there are many potential issues and
challenges with successfully performing such a basic test. This article includes
an overview of the testing procedures and presents some common pitfalls
associated with performing these tests.</p>



<p><strong>Test Description</strong></p>



<p><em>The
Test Description information in the following section was extracted from an
article written by Raymond Tombaugh, Sr. Coatings Consultant with KTA that was
posted to KTA University in 2018 titled, “</em><em>Coating Adhesion Testing using Knife/Tape Methods.”</em><em> </em></p>



<p>“Two
test methods are described in ASTM D3359: Method A (X-cut), and Method B
(Cross-cut).&nbsp; Test Method A is primarily
intended for use on coatings/coating systems over 5 mils (125 µm), while Method
B is generally used on coatings/coatings systems less than 5 mils thick. Either
method can be performed in the shop, field or laboratory. The test was
developed for assessing the adhesion of coating to steel but can be used on
other hard substrates.&nbsp; The test has also
been used successfully on softer substrates (e.g., wood and plaster).</p>



<p>Both
tests are performed by scribing the coating to the substrate with a sharp knife
blade in a specific pattern, applying a pressure sensitive tape and then
rapidly pulling the tape from the surface.&nbsp;
When the coating is greater than 5-mils thick, an X-cut (with each leg
approximately 1.5-inches long) is made into the film.&nbsp; When the coating is less than 5-mils thick, a
cross-cut lattice pattern is created with either six or eleven cuts in each
direction.&nbsp; For coatings up to 2 mils
thick, eleven incisions are made that are spaced 1 mm apart. For coatings between
2 mils and 5 mils thick, six incisions are spaced 2 mm apart. For both methods,
a steel or other hard metal straightedge or template is recommended to ensure
straight cuts and, in the case of the X-cut, the correct angle at the intersection
(30-45°).</p>



<p>Once the incisions are made, a pressure sensitive tape (with adhesive properties conforming to the requirements of the standard; Figure 1) is applied over the incisions and pressed in place using a pencil eraser.  Following a brief “recovery” period of about 60 seconds the tape is removed by grasping the free end of the tape and pulling it off rapidly (not jerked) back upon itself at as close to an angle of 180° as possible.  After removal of the tape, the amount of coating removed from the substrate or underlying coating is rated. It is important to evaluate the coated surface and not the back of the tape, since coating debris from the incisions is often removed by the tape.                                                                        </p>

<p>Adhesion
is rated based on the scale provided in the ASTM standard.&nbsp; The scale ranges from 0 &#8220;Removal beyond
the area of the incisions” to 5 &#8220;No peeling or removal.” When Method A is
used an “A” is included after the numerical adhesion value (e.g., 3A).&nbsp; Similarly, a “B” is added after the numerical
value when Method B is used (e.g., 3B).&nbsp;
Table 1 provides the evaluation criteria for Method A; Table 2 provides
the evaluation criteria for Method B.&nbsp;
The standard also contains a pictorial guide to aid in the rating of the
cross-cut (Method B).</p>

<p>When appropriate, the nature and location of
the separation is documented.&nbsp; A cohesive
separation is one that occurs within a coating layer; an adhesive separation is
one that occurs between coating layers or between the coating and the
substrate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, adhesion ratings
of 4 and 5 are considered good, adhesion values of 2 and 3 are considered
marginal and adhesion values of 0 and 1 are considered poor.</p>



<p><strong>Issues and Challenges</strong></p>



<p>Following are ten issues and
challenges when performing tape adhesion testing on coating systems. The list
is not exhaustive but addresses some of the more common pitfalls to avoid.
Those listed below are in the order in which they would be performed during
actual testing.</p>



<p><strong><em>Using the Appropriate Method:</em></strong> ASTM D3359
describes two test methods for evaluating tape adhesion of a coating system:
Method A (X-cut Tape Test) and Method B (Cross-cut Tape Test). The method
selected is based on the total thickness of the coating system to be evaluated.
Method B is used for coating systems up to 5 mils thick and Method A is used
for coating systems in excess of 5 mils. The spacing between incisions for
Method B is generally 1mm to 2mm apart depending on the thickness of the
coating.</p>



<p><strong><em>Creating the Correct Angle at the Intersection for Method A: </em></strong>According to the standard, each of the two legs of the X-cut should be 1.5” long and the intersection of the X-cut should produce an angle between 30° and 45°. When this angle is produced correctly, the horizontal distance between the top two legs of the X-cut should be 1”. Since the tape used is 1” wide, the entire X-cut should be covered by the tape. An X-cut intersection that is too wide or too narrow may affect the adhesion rating. A special template (Figure 2) is available to help ensure the X-cut is made correctly.</p>

<p><strong><em>Creating the Correct Spacing Between Parallel Incisions for Method B: </em></strong>According to the standard, the spacing between parallel incisions is 1mm for coatings up to 2 mils thick and 2mm for coatings greater than 2 mils thick up to 5 mils thick. Incisions made too close together, too far apart, or that do not remain parallel can produce misleading ratings. Incisions made too close together can cause the coating to “ribbon-off” and those made too far apart can result in false high adhesion ratings. A special template (Figure 3) is available to help ensure the spacing is correct. Alternatively, a multi-blade cutter can be used to generate the cross-cut pattern (Figure 4).</p>

<p><strong><em>Blade Sharpness:
</em></strong>Section 5.1 of the Standard (applying to Test Method A) describes the cutting
tool as a sharp razor blade, scalpel, knife, or other cutting device and notes
the importance that the cutting edge be in good condition. Section 10.1 of the
Standard (applying to Test Method B) describes the cutting tool as a sharp
razor blade, scalpel, knife, or other cutting device having a cutting-edge
angle between 15 and 30° that will make either a single cut or several cuts at
once. It also notes the importance that the cutting edge or edges be in good
condition. It is common to use a utility knife to make the incisions. A dull
blade or cutting edge can cause chipping (or “chatter”), or tearing of the
coating along the incision, resulting in a false, low rating; therefore, it is
critical that the cutting edge be sharp. Since use of a knife blade in this
manner (making an incision down to the base metal or other hard substrate)
tends to dull the blade quickly, it may be necessary to replace the blade frequently.</p>



<p><strong><em>Depth of Incisions:</em></strong> The incisions
made with the cutting tool (for Method A or B) must penetrate through all
coating layers to the metal substrate using one steady motion. This should be
verified visually and with the aid of a magnifier if necessary. This is
particularly important when using the multi-blade cutter. All of the blades must remain in
contact with, and held perpendicular to, the surface during use, and care taken
to assure that all blades cut through the coating to the substrate in a single
pull&nbsp; If the
substrate hasn’t been reached, the operator needs to move to a new location. It
is important not to attempt to re-cut a previous incision as it may result in a
false rating.</p>



<p><strong><em>Removing Chalk/Dirt from the
Surface Prior to Test</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Since adhesive tape is used in the test, it is
important that the adhesive adhere well to the coating surface. Any chalking
from deteriorated paint, dirt, oils, moisture, or other surface contaminants
will interfere with the adhesion of the tape and could yield false adhesion
ratings. It is permissible to clean the surface prior to testing if these
surface conditions are present. Also, after the incisions are made, any debris
should be removed with a soft bristle brush prior to attaching the adhesive tape.</p>



<p><strong><em>Tape Type/Using
Fresh Tape: </em></strong>Section 5.3 of the Standard describes the tape as 25-mm (1.0-in.) wide
semitransparent pressure sensitive type with an adhesion strength agreed upon
by the supplier and the user. It also cautions that there may be variability in
adhesion strength of the tape from batch-to-batch and with time. The ASTM
standard does not require a specific type or manufacturer of tape to use. Currently
two companies (SEMicro and Elcometer) manufacture a tape (CHT and P99,
respectively) specifically for this test method that possess the same backing
and adhesive strength as the tape referenced by earlier versions of the
standard (Permacel 99), which is no longer available. Since there is no
specific tape to use, it is important to agree on the type to be used in
advance of any testing. </p>



<p>Further, Sections 7.4
and 12.6 instruct the operator to remove two full wraps of tape from the roll
and discard prior to each day of testing and before performing testing. The
adhesive on the tape closest to the outer side of the role and exposed to air
may have degraded due to exposure to sunlight (solar radiation) and/or
temperature. This practice helps ensure fresh adhesive is on the tape used to
conduct testing. Most of these tapes have a shelf life and should not be used
once expired. Shelf life can be determined from the Lot No.</p>



<p><strong><em>Using an Eraser to Ensure Tape
Bond:</em></strong> Sections
7.5 and 12.7 state that an eraser on the end of a pencil should be used to
ensure good contact between the tape and test area, and to examine the color
under the tape to verify good contact. While the location of the eraser (end of
a pencil) is likely moot (a separate eraser can be used), the end of the
utility knife, thumb pressure or other means of ensuring positive contact are
not as effective and may yield different results. An eraser is pliable and can
conform to slight surface irregularities, making it an ideal tool for ensuring
good contact between the tape and the test area.</p>



<p><strong><em>Tape Direction
of Pull: </em></strong>Sections
7.6 and 12.8 state that the tape should be removed within
90 +/- 30 seconds of application by seizing the free end and pulling it off
rapidly (not jerked) back upon itself at as close to an angle of 180° as
possible. It is important to peel back the tape and not pull upwards since the purpose
of the tape is to remove poorly adhered coating so that the X-cut or cross-cut
area can be correctly evaluated; it is not intended to remove intact coatings.</p>



<p><strong><em>Evaluating the Test Area,
Not the Tape: </em></strong>Sections 7.7 and 12.9 instruct the operator to inspect
the X-cut area (Method A) or grid area (Method B) for coating removal, not the
tape. Since incisions are made into the coating system, the tape will almost
always have coating on it; therefore, it is important to base the rating on the
test area only.</p>
